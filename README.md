# Light-HLS: Fast, Accurate and Convenient 

*Let's try to make HLS developemnt easier for everyone~ ^\_^.*
     


Light-HLS is a light weight high-level synthesis (HLS) framework for academic exploration and evaluation, which can be called to perform various design space exploration (DSE) for FPGA-based HLS design. It covers the abilities of previous works, overcomes the existing limitations and brings more practical features. Light-HLS is modularized and portable so designers can use the components of Light-HLS to conduct various DSE procedures.  Light-HLS gets rid of RTL code generation so it will not suffer from the time-consuming synthesis of commercial HLS tools like VivadoHLS, which involves many detailed operations in both its frond-end and back-end.

## Light-HLS Frond-End

The goal of Light-HLS frond-end is to generate IR code close enough to those generated via commercial tools, like VivadoHLS, for DSE purpose. In the front-end of Light-HLS, initial IR codes generated via Clang will be processed by HLS optimization passes consisted of three different levels: (a) At instruction level, Light-HLS modifies, removes or reorders the instructions, e.g. reducing bitwidth,  removing redundant instruction  and reordering computation. (b) At loop/function level, functions will be instantiated and loops may be extracted into sub-functions. (c) As for memory access level, redundant load/store instructions will be removed based on dependency analysis.

## Light-HLS Back-End

The back-end of Light-HLS is developed to schedule and bind for the optimized IR codes, so it can predict the resultant performance and resource cost accurately based on the given settings. The IR instructions can be automatically characterized by Light-HLS and a corresponding library, which records the timing and resource of different types of operations, will be generated. For scheduling, based on the generated library, Light-HLS maps most operations to corresponding cycles based on as-soon-as-possible (ASAP) strategy. For some pipelined loops, the constraints of the port number of the BRAMs and loop-carried dependencies are considered. Moreover, some operations might be scheduled as late as possible (ALAP) to lower the II. 	As for resource binding, Light-HLS accumulates the resource cost by each operation and the chaining of operations is considered. The reusing of hardware resource is an important feature in HLS and Light-HLS reuses resources based on more detailed rules, e.g. the source and type of input.

## Light-HLS Application Scenariors

Let's first see what we can do with Light-HLS in the research about HLS.

1. HLS designs can be set with various configurations, leading to different results of performance and resource. To find the optmial solution, designers can determine the configuration and call Light-HLS to predict the result in tens milliseconds, which will be close to the result in VivadoHLS. An example is **[Hi-ClockFlow](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Hi-ClockFlow)**, a tool which searches for the configuration of clock settings and HLS directives for the multi-clock dataflow.

2. HLS designs are sensitive to the source codes, some of which are friendly to FPGA while the others are not. If researchers want to analyze and optimize the design at source code level, Light-HLS have accomplished the back-tracing from back-end, to front-end, to source code, so researchers can find out which part of source code have some interesting behaviors causing problems. In the example **[Hi-ClockFlow](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Hi-ClockFlow)**, Light-HLS helps to partition the source code and map the performance and resource to the different parts of the source code.

3. In the front-end of HLS, source code will be processed by a series of LLVM Passes for analysis and optimization. However, for most of researchers, even if they come up with an idea for the front-end processing, they can hardly estimate the exact outcome of the solution if it can be applied to the commercial HLS tools. Currently, Light-HLS can generate IR code similar to the one generated by VivadoHLS and provide accurate scheduling and resource binding in back-end. Therefore, researchers might implement a Pass, plug it into the front-end of Light-HLS (Yes, just plug ^_^), and evaluate it with the back-end of Light-HLS to see the effect.

4. In the back-end of HLS, the IR instructions/blocks/loops/functions are scheduled and binded to specific hardware resource on FPGA. Based on the IR code similar to the one generated by commercial tools, how to properly schedule the source code and bind the resource can be tested and analyzed with Light-HLS. Currently, Light-HLS can provide the estimated performance and resource cost close to those from VivadoHLS 2018.2. (We will catch up the version of 2019.2 recently.) Light-HLS can generate the library of the timing and resource cost of all the IR instructions, e.g. add, fmul, MAC, fptoui and etc, for a specified devive, like Zedboard. Researchers can change the original scheme of Light-HLS's scheduling and binding to see the effect.

            ./Light_HLS_Top ../../../App/conv/conv.cc convs ../config_conv.txt DEBUG
   
 
## [Usage of Light-HLS](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS#usage-of-light-hls)

**For general evaluation of a design:**

1. download the repository (entire project)
2. the organization of this repository is: (1) basic functiones and passes are implemented in the directory **["Implementations"](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations)**. Nearly all the directories have their own README file to explain the directory. (2) experiments are tested in the directory **["Test"](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Tests)**. (3) by making a "build" directory and using CMake in each experiment directory (e.g. **[this one](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Tests/LLVM_exp5_SimpleTimingAnalysis/)**), executable can be generated and tried. (hint: cmake .. & make)  (4) for user's convenience, we prepare some scripts for example, **BuildAllFiles.sh**, which will build all the projects, **CleanBuiltFiles.sh**, which will clean all the built files to shrink the size of the directories, and **Build.sh** in test directory, which will just build one test project. All these scripts can be run directly.
3. looking into the source codes which we have provided detailed comments, reader can trace the headers and functions to understand how the experiment work. Moreover, the README file in each directory will give you an overall understanding what the code is implemented for.
4. in the directory **[HLS_Data_Lib](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/HLS_Data_Lib)**, there is the library of the IR instructions on FPGA. Currently, the library is built for Zedboard (Xilinx Platform ID: xc7z020clg484-1). If you want to use Light-HLS for another platform, you can regenerate the library by using the **[LibGen.py](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/blob/master/HLS_Lib_Generator/LibGen.py)**, which will collect the information from VivadoHLS and designers can overwrite the library in HLS_Data_Lib with the new one. The LibGen.py supports multiple processes to accelerate the procedure. An example is shown below. 

         python LibGen.py -n 12 -p xc7z020clg484-1

5. Light-HLS supports HLS directives for the design, including loop unrolling, loop pipelining, array partitioning, static array setting, dataflow and clock settings, which can be set in a configuration file. An example is shown in **[config_2mm.txt](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/blob/master/Tests/Light_HLS_Top/config_2mm.txt)** and **[config_conv.txt](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/blob/master/Tests/Light_HLS_Top/config_conv.txt)**. If you want to check the loops' labels, please run Light-HLS with loop configurations first and the source code with labels for loop, "tmp_loopLabeled.cc", will be generated in the directory. If you need to set array partition for the arrays, please note that in Light-HLS, the definition of the order of dimentsion is shown like   \[...\]\[second dimension\]\[first dimension\].

6. As you can notice in the usage examples, Light-HLS can run with DEBUG flag and lots of information during the HLS procedure will be dumped for analysis.

**For optimization:**

In Light-HLS, many useful hints or informations are provided in runtime public variables or dumped log files for further optimization.

1. For design configuration optimization, Light-HLS provides users with the information of loops and arrays. For examples: (1) Light-HLS can [detect thost targets, e.g. loops and arrays, which can be set HLS directives](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_PragmaTargetExtraction). (2) Light-HLS will [indicate whether an array partitioning is useful to improve performance](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/blob/master/Implementations/HI_WithDirectiveTimingResourceEvaluation/HI_WithDirectiveTimingResourceEvaluation_BramInfo.cc#L2518-L2545).(3) Light-HLS can [evaluate the parallelism relationship between arrays and loops, which helps designer to proper partition arrays or unroll loops, e.g. some arrays should be partitioned when a specific loop is unrolled](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/blob/master/Implementations/HI_ArraySensitiveToLoopLevel/HI_ArraySensitiveToLoopLevel_BramAccessTracer.cc#L881-L1012).

2. For timing optimization, Light-HLS records the information of scheduling. Following are the examples: (1) The basic scheduling information, such as the timing of loops/functions/basic blocks and the scheduling of each instruction. (2) The log file presenting the iterative search procedure for different pipeline initiation intervals with the information of conflicts of BRAM access and the dependences among different accesses.

3. For resource optimization, more than indicating the resource cost of each instruction, Light-HLS

## [Implementation of Light-HLS and Further development](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS#implementation-of-light-hls-and-further-development)

### The Overview of Light-HLS Implementation

As shown in **[Light_HLS_Top.cc](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/blob/master/Tests/Light_HLS_Top/Light_HLS_Top.cc)**, the procedure of Light-HLS contains mainly four steps:

1. [Clang part for Front-End Processing](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS#1-clang-part-for-front-end-processing): 

         extract the information of arrays in the source code   
         set labels for each loop in the source code   

2. [Front-End Passes for FPGA-Oriented Optimizations and Transformation](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS#2-front-end-passes-for-fpga-oriented-optimizations-and-transformation):     

         
         Function Level: Function Instantiation     
         Loop Level: Loop Extraction / Loop Simplification / Index Variable Simplify / Loop Stregnth Reducation / Loop Unrolling                               
         General Instruction Level:  Duplicated Instruction Removal / Multiplication Optimization / Reduction Optimization / Instruction Hoisting / Bitwidth Reduction / etc..      
         Memory Access Level:  GEPLowering / Redundant Access Removal


3. [Front-End Passes just before Back-End Analysis](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS#3-front-end-passes-just-before-back-end-analysis):

         map the IR loops to the loop labels in the source code for the configurations of loops. 
         mainly account for inserting MUX for the accesses to array partitions.   

4. [Backend-end Pass](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS#4-backend-end-pass)

         for scheduling and binding       
         After running this Pass, the information will be stored in
         The public variables of the Pass pointer.                 
         such as function latencies, loop tripcounts and etc.  

### 1. Clang part for Front-End Processing

**A. For Arrays**

In this part, we need to extract the information of arrays in the source code, which might be lost in the IR code after the Clang processing. For example, if declared in the interface of functions, the information of the arrays' first dimension might be removed in the IR code. This may lead to the situation that we cannot apply the partitioning to specific dimensions properly. In the processing at Clang level, we can [extract such informantion from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with HI_FunctionInterfaceInfo](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_FunctionInterfaceInfo).

**B. For Loops**

From another perspective, the loops in IR codes are named according to LLVM rules, which might not be easy to map them to the original source code. Therefore, we need to [set label for each loop with Hi_LoopLabeler](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_LoopLabeler), so designers can easier specify the loops for configurations.
    
*WARNING: Currently, Light-HLS cannot process the type of struct/class in C/C++. We are working on them!*

### 2. Front-End Passes for FPGA-Oriented Optimizations and Transformation

In this part, Light-HLS will transform the IR code according to the FPGA characteristics for optimization. 

**A. Function Level:** 

(A.1) Function Instantiation: In C/C++ source code, a function might be reused to process different data. For CPU, the function can be consistent for different data source during compilation. However, for FPGA, if the function processes data with different structures, e.g. they are partitioned with different factors, [the function needs to be instantiated by Light-HLS for different data](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_FunctionInstantiation), for different analysis and optimizations.

**B. Loop Level:**

(B.1) Loop Extraction: This is an optimization for loop level optimization. In HLS, the functions processing independent objects can be run concurrently. Therefore, extracting the loops into functions can help to raise the parallelism among loops. In LLVM-9.0.0, [LoopExtractor Pass](https://llvm.org/doxygen/LoopExtractor_8cpp.html) has been implemented.

(B.2) Loop Simplification / Index Variable Simplify: For further analysis of loops, e.g. tripcount evaluation and header/exit detection, Light-HLS needs to canonicalize natural loops. [What is canpnical loops?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_loop) *WARNING: Currently, Light-HLS cannot process non-canpnical loop, for which we are dealing with.*

(B.3) Loop Strength Reduction (LSR): In the loops, there could be some expressions involving the index variables of the loops. Loop strength reduction will try to transform those operations into more efficient operations, e.g. from multiplication to addition, (A = i*30  =>  A = A + 30 (i is a index of loop)). LLVM provides [LSR Pass](https://llvm.org/doxygen/LoopStrengthReduce_8cpp.html) but [some multiplications, used in address calculation, may stay after loop strength reduction, if the target machine has scaled index addressing mode.](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2019-April/131826.html) However, FPGA is not one of the target machine of official LLVM. In order to enforce the LSR for HLS, Light-HLS includes [its own LSR Pass](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_AggressiveLSR_MUL).

(B.4) Loop Unrolling: Unrolling a loop could be benificial to FPGA parallelism, since after unrolling, those independent instructions can be executed concurrently. LLVM provides [Loop Unrolling Pass](https://llvm.org/doxygen/LoopUnroll_8cpp.html) which targets at CPU-like devices and unrolls loops according to specific criterias. However, for FPGA, we want to enforce loop unrolling for some loops and therefore, referring to the LLVM Pass, Light-HLS provides [a loop unroller](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_LoopUnroll) which will unroll loop according to the configuration file, which specifies the unrolling factor and the label of the loops should be unrolled.

**C. General Instruction Level:**

(C.1) Duplicated Instruction Removal: Duplicated instructions are those instructions with the same opcode and the same operands in the IR code. This kind of situations may usually occur after loop unrolling and GER lowering, since there could be the similar instructions in different iterations or the calculation of different addresses. Light-HLS will [remove those duplicated ones to reduce the cost for FPGA implementation](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_HLSDuplicateInstRm).

(C.2) Multiplication Optimization: A series of multiplication operations (reduction) can be [transformed into a multiplier tree]((https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_MulOrderOpt)) or [just ordered them to postpone the accesses](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/blob/master/Implementations/HI_LoadALAP/HI_LoadALAP.cc) to reduce computation latency. Moreover, some multiplication with constant can be [transformed into shift operation](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_Mul2Shl) to reduce overhead.

(C.3) Addition Optimization: A series of addition operations (reduction) can be [ordered them to postpone the accesses](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/blob/master/Implementations/HI_LoadALAP/HI_LoadALAP.cc).

(C.4) Instruction Hoisting: There could be instructions in branches: some of them are actually independent with the branch PHI operations or some of them are shared among branches. For these situations, [the instructions might be hoisted from the branches to their dominant nodes](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_IntstructionMoveBackward), so the instructions could be executed in advance or in parallel with other previous operations, to lower the latency.

(C.5) Bitwidth Optimization: On FPGA, the arbitrary precision integers are supported and the overhead of the operations are sensitive to the bitwidth of the operations. Therefore, [bitwidth optimization is important for FPGA HLS, which is implemented by Light-HLS](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_VarWidthReduce).

**D. Memory Access Level:**

(D.1) GEPLowering: GEP is an operation in LLVM to get the element pointer for the accesses to arrays. An array could have multiple dimensions and GEP helps to map the accesses to array to the exact memory address. However, the on-chip memory of FPGA are mainly BRAMs, which are actually "single-dimension". In order to ensure that the instructions can get data from BRAMs, Light-HLS lowers the GEP to those exact operations of address calculation. For example, for the access B\[i\]\[j\] to the array B\[70\]\[20\], Light-HLS will [transform the GEP operation into the multiplication and addition](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_SeparateConstOffsetFromGEP), e.g. i*20+j.

(D.2) Redundant Access Removal: There could be many redundant memory accesses in IR code, especially after loop unrolling. Here, [Light-HLS removes those some of accesses](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_RemoveRedundantAccess), assuming that FPGA is the only one device processing those data. 



### 3. Front-End Passes just before Back-End Analysis

**A. For the Loops:**

Since during HLS, Light-HLS needs to map the configuration of loops to the IR code, such as pipeline II and unroll factor, for scheduling. Therefore, Light-HLS uses a Pass [to extract related information from the debug metadata](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_IR2SourceCode).

**B. For the Arrays:**

For array partitioning, some accesses might fail to be mapped to certain partition during compilation. Therefore, Light-HLS need to [insert MUX for them](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_MuxInsertionArrayPartition) to support runtime selection and introduce MUX delay in scheduling.

### 4. Backend-end Pass

**A. [Scheduling](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_WithDirectiveTimingResourceEvaluation):** 

During scheduling, Light-HLS map the instructions to exact cycle in the runtime so they can be controlled by the FSM in FPGA implementation. The scheduling is processed at different levels, including functions, loops, basic blokcs and individual instructions. The loop pipelining and the instruction chaining are considered during scheduling.

**B. [Binding](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS/tree/master/Implementations/HI_WithDirectiveTimingResourceEvaluation):**

Each operation is realized on FPGA with certain resource. Light-HLS can help designers collect the information of each type of operation from VivadoHLS. Then, during resource binding, Light-HLS will map the operation to specifc resource cost, accoring to the requirement of timing and the type and bitwidth of operands. In the binding, the resource reuse and the operation chaining are considered.
