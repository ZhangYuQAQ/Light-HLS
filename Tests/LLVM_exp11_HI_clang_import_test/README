LLVM_exp10_HI_APIntegerAnalysis is used to test the the frontend action HI_APIntegerAnalysis

HI_APIntegerAnalysis is based on Clang LibTooling

It implement a frontend action to find the declartions of arbitrary precision integer and add comments in the source code to mark those declartions.

Such implementation is based on the following hierarchy:

                        declare a rewriter
                              |  pass the pointer to
                 call         V
frontend action  --->   the creator
        |                     |  create / pass the rewriter
        |   Src Code          V
        ------------->   AST consumer
                              |
                              |  generate AST
                              V
                           Visitor (visit the nodes in AST and do the rewritting)
